!!! NOT YET FINISH AND IT PROBABLY NEVER WILL !!!


BLCF is a rpg game written in C++ with the [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) where you evolves in 2D world.
The game was developped mainly to learn about oriented object paradigm and C++ langage.
The repository is [here](https://github.com/NormanMarlier/blcf).

### Physical engine
The physical engine of the game is simple. It juste computes the hit box of the character and the environment.
Most of the work is done in this part.

### 2D World
The 2D world is made by using the free software [Tile map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) and free tilsets in Internet (obsiously, I take tilesets which have the same features).
A lot of a work is needed in this part of this project.

### Game play
The player swtiches between two interfaces :
1. The player moves in the 2D world and interacts with its environment
2. The players figths against monsters in a turn-based battle.
